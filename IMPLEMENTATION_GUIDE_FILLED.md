### About Page
**Extended Company Story**:
```
John Kruger Automotive has been serving Salt Lake City and surrounding communities since 2003. Owner John Kruger founded the business with a simple mission: to provide honest, trustworthy automotive service with the highest levels of integrity.

After years working in the auto repair industry, John noticed a lack of honesty and professionalism among many shops. He wanted to create a new standard for automotive service along the Wasatch Front - one that would inspire confidence, trust, and fairness in every customer interaction.

Today, we're known as the premier Honda, Toyota, and Subaru specialists in the area. We've completed hundreds of Subaru head gasket repairs and have extensive experience with the unique needs of these three brands. As a certified Bumper to Bumper service center and part of the Federated Car Care program, we provide nationwide warranty coverage and maintain the highest standards of service.
